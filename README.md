## Observed Problems
There are a lot of problems in the real world about Computer Science.  
And they can be classified into 2 major categories.  
- **Problems due to Lack of Appropriate Machinary Solutions and Mechanisms for Computing**.  
and 
- **Problems due to Lack of Appropriate Digital Solutions between Human and Machine(which bridges other human)**.   
Those problems within the categories are not absolutely separated.  
There is a intersection between them definitely.  
---
### Problems due to Lack of Appropriate Machinary Solutions and Mechanisms for Computing
- [ ] Lack of efficient way for solving problem related to real world requiring explosive cost.


### Problems due to Lack of Appropriate Digital Solutions between Human and Machine(which bridges other human)
- [ ] Lack of proper digital solution for recording and analyzing Human life by themselves.
- [ ] Lack of efficient and easy way to utilize computing resource and construct own solution by Human without knowledge of IT systems.
- [ ] Lack of rich and explicit way to see(visualize) the network between each other in Social Network.
